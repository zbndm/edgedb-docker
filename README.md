# The official Docker image for EdgeDB

This repository contains the officially maintained Docker image packaging
EdgeDB and the EdgeDB CLI.

#### ✨[Documentation](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/guides/deployment/docker)✨

## When to use this image

This image is intended for use in production, or as part of a
development setup that involves multiple containers orchestrated by
Docker Compose or a similar tool. Otherwise, we recommend using the [`edgedb CLI`](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/guides/quickstart) to install EdgeDB and
manage local instances.

## What is EdgeDB?

[EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com) is an open-source object-relational database
built on top of PostgreSQL, featuring:

- strict, object-oriented typed schema;
- powerful and expressive query language;
- rich standard library;
- built-in support for schema migrations;
- native GraphQL support.
